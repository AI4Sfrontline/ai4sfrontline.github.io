I am currently a Ph.D. student at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). My research primarily focuses on the application of artificial intelligence in analytical chemistry and metabolomics.

Prior to that, I obtained the Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Statistics and Mathematics at [Shandong University of Finance and Economics](https://www.sdufe.edu.cn/). Subsequently, I engaged in research within the field of pharmaceutical informatics at the [State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines](https://sklnm.cpu.edu.cn/), [China Pharmaceutical University](https://www.cpu.edu.cn/), and earned the Master's degree in Applied Statistics under the supervision of Prof. [Hua Yang](https://ygl.cpu.edu.cn/gmis5/dsfc/dsfcgrxx/D84FD2ED7B95527E0C23D4E3DC685EE6).

<strong>My research interests include:</strong>
  
<ul>
<li>New technologies for analyzing complex structure based on deep learning</li>
<li>AI-based metabolic network modeling and optimization</li>
<li>Metabolomics data processing and analysis workflow</li>
<li>Applications of AI in synthetic biology</li>
<li>Natural language processing in chemistry</li>
</ul>
